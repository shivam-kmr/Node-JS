# Node-JS
All my node JS project!
As i am a self learner, I love to get knowledge about the technology the industry is using. So keeping me on that that i learn languages and try to keep me and the technology working on the same track!
I know i can't grasp things too fast but i always try my best to do a certain type of work. The firstmost and the last thing that matters to me is the time.
